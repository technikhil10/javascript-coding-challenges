//Coding Challenge #1

// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
// and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
// ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
// m tall.


//Solution

//According to Data1:
//Mass of both
const massJohn = 92
const massMarks = 78

//Heights of both
const heightJohn = 1.95
const heightMarks = 1.69

//Applying BMI Formula

const marksBMI = massMarks/(heightMarks ** 2)
const johnBMI = massJohn/(heightJohn ** 2)

const markHigherBMI = (marksBMI <= johnBMI);

if(!markHigherBMI){
    console.log(`According to Data 1: Mark's BMI(${marksBMI}) is higher than John's BMI(${johnBMI})`);
}
else{
    console.log(`According to Data 1: John's BMI(${johnBMI}) is higher than Mark's BMI(${marksBMI})`);
}
